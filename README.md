Waterslide
==========

Waterslide is a companion to PlayNice.ly, an excellent team collaboration service.

Waterslide provides a "feedback" button for your website, similar to those from Get Satisfaction, User Voice, and others. However, instead of a community support forum, the feedback goes directly into your PlayNice.ly project. This allows for a much lighter weight alternative to a full community forum, while still providing a quick and easy way for your users to send you bugs and ideas while using your site.

Setup
-----

To get up and running, just make sure you have the `sinatra` and `playnicely` gems installed. Then just run `ruby -rubygems app.rb` from the base directory. If you're using the Sinatra defaults, you should just be able to point your browser to `http://localhost:4567` to view the demo on your local computer. 

You should be able to use the Javascript and CSS without too much trouble on your site, but you'll obviously want to incorporate the sample Ruby code into your own existing application.
